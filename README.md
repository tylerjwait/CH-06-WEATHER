# CH-06-WEATHER API APP

## This was  project to build a web API app using OpenWeather API to display the current weather is a searched city. I enjoyed this project but had alot of trouble with the API for awhile and restarted the project about 3 times. I finally was able to get it to work. I used Bulma, JavaScript, and HTML to complete this project.
